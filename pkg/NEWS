1.2	o isominmax within monotoneDirection changed, original code was replaced by pava from Iso package; such a change decresed computational time to 40%
	o robust option based on median polish was added to ORCME
1.2.1	o isominmax within monotoneDirection changed, so procedure works for zero variability within dose as well
1.2	o bug in clustering process was fixed (the performance of algorithm should slightly improve)
1.1	o the artificial data set was replaced by larger real data set, due to confidentiality just part of the original data set was used
1.0	o the library was changed significantly to correspond with the book: Modeling Dose-response Microarray Data in Early Drug Development Experiments With R
0.0-6
	o fixed rownames (Tine Casneuf)
0.0-5
	o check that dose is character of lenght one 
	  for ExpressionSet,character-method
	o added simple test for ExpressionSet,character-method
0.0-4
	o removed IsoGene dependency
	o fixed isoClust S4 methods
0.0-3
	o added esData (ExpressionSet)
	o made isoClust an S4 generic
	o added method ExpressionSet,character
	o added method matrix,factor
0.0-2
	o added simulated data (doseData, geneData)
	o added example using simulated data
	o added tests directory with additional examples
	  for other scenarios
	o added rudimentary vignette
